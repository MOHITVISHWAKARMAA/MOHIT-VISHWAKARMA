## 💡 What Sets Me Apart

### 🎯 **Business-First Mindset**
I don't just build models—I ask "What decision will this enable?" before writing a single line of code. Every analysis starts with understanding stakeholder pain points.

### ⚡ **Rapid Execution**
From project kickoff to first dashboard: **< 2 weeks**. I believe in MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and iterative improvement based on feedback.

### 🗣️ **Communication = Superpower**
I've presented to C-level executives, sales teams, and technical audiences. I can explain Random Forest in plain English or dive deep into SQL optimization—whatever the audience needs.

### 🤝 **Collaborative Spirit**
Worked across 4 cross-functional teams (sales, marketing, legal, operations). I bridge the gap between business and tech by speaking both languages fluently.
